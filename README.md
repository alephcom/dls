# Description
Set of tools to work with Dominion Land Survey (DLS) and Alberta Township Survey (ATS) locations.  These tools were put together due to a lack of free/reliable/easily accessible public sources for this data.

# Quick Overview
Western Canada is surveyed into sections with the [Dominion Land Survey (DLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_Land_Survey) method.  The tools in this library aren't fully accurate but for many applications they are close enough.
